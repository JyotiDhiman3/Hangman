The following folder contains these files:
1. Hangman.pl
2. README.txt
To execute the program, the user need to enter- perl Hangman.pl command.
Then the program will ask the user to enter an input.
NOTE:Make sure that the input is a single alpha-numeric character. Also,make sure that
the character is lower case.
After we enter the input,the program will check if the input has been already guessed 
or not and then it updates the correctly guessed and wrongly guessed array.
Then the program outputs the current state of hangman and the correctly guessed and 
the wrongly guessed array.
If all the parts of hangman are drawn before we could guess the word,then the user will 
lose the game and the program exits.
Else if the user guessed the word correctly,then a winning message will be displayed 
and the program will exit.
